## Assignment Questions

1. Include discussion of the quantitative analysis that lead to your prediction. This can include any analysis you complete but must include at least two histograms and some quantitative discussion of flow quantiles that helped you make your decision.

**Ans:**
`
`

2. Describe the variable flow_data:
- What is it?
- What type of values is composed of?
- What is are its dimensions, and total size?

**Ans:**
`
`

3. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?

**Ans:**
`
`

4. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)

**Ans:**
`
`

5. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?

**Ans:**
`
`

## Estimation4 Explanation

For my third estimate, I decided to use and transform a prewritten python code using Visual Studio Code.  The python code, I wrote, allowed me to compare different years (2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020) in the week leading up to the 14th of September (09-06-year through 09-12-year).  I also took the week flow data described and calculated the min, max, mean, and STDV of the flow lists I created.  I eventually want to create a linear regression on the data, but I will have to wait until we are allowed to do so.  I was trying to create a 'For' loop that involved the year part of the dates as well, but this turned out to be too ambitious for the time I had to work on it.  Sorry for the late submission of the markdown file.  I spent too much time on the coding part of this assignment.

## My Python Code3:

The Python Code, created in Visual Studio Code (VSC), can be found [here](../assignment_4/week4_numpy_starter_BM.py).  Let me know if you would like me to put it in the "Submissions" folder instead of using a link.  Trying to get a better way to organize my files for future HW assignments.

## Works Cited:

[My estimate,](https://github.com/HAS-Tools-Fall2020/forecasting/blob/master/forecast_entries/mitchell.csv) given in row 4 of *mitchell.csv*, was estimated by the creation and application of the python code presented above.  The data used for this estimate was obtained via the USGS NWIS [mapper](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/) for the gage number 09506000.
