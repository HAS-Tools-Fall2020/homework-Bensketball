## Estimation Explanation

I decided to use the graph below to make my discharge estimation:
___
![graph1](USGS.09506000.5707.00060.00003.20190824.20191231.log.0.p50.gif "Discharge for gage 09506000, 07/31/2019 to 12/31/2019")
___
As said, this is a relative estimate of discharge using only the orange-colored line (Median daily statistical (41 years)) presenting in the graph above.  The graph goes from 07/31/2019 to 12/31/2019, the period of interest in making future predictions.
