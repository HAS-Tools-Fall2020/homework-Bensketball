## Estimation Explanation

For my first estimate, I decided to utilize the graph below:
___
![graph1](USGS.09506000.5707.00060.00003.20190824.20191231.log.0.p50.gif "Discharge for gage# 09506000, 07/31/2019 to 12/31/2019")
___
As said, [my estimate](https://github.com/HAS-Tools-Fall2020/forecasting/blob/master/forecast_entries/mitchell.csv) titled *mitchell.csv* utilized only the orange-colored line, *Median daily statistical (41 years)*, presenting in the graph above.  The graph goes from 07/31/2019 to 12/31/2019, the period of interest in making future predictions.  The data graphed and represented here was obtained via the USGS NWIS [mapper](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/) for the gage number 09506000.  Thank you!
