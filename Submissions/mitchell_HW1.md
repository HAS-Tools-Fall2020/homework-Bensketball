## Estimation Explanation

For my first estimate, I decided to utilize the graph below:
___
![graph1](USGS.09506000.5707.00060.00003.20190824.20191231.log.0.p50.gif "Discharge for gage# 09506000, 07/31/2019 to 12/31/2019")
___
As said, this is a relative estimate of discharge using only the orange-colored line, *Median daily statistical (41 years)*, presenting in the graph above.  The graph goes from 07/31/2019 to 12/31/2019, the period of interest in making future predictions.
