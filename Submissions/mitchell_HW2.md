## Estimation2 Explanation

For my second estimate, I decided to use a prewritten python code using Visual Studio Code.  The python code allowed me to look at specific individual dates that I would plug in myself.  The code has been manipulated to given more than one year per date being estimated (3 different past years).  [My estimate,](https://github.com/HAS-Tools-Fall2020/forecasting/blob/master/forecast_entries/mitchell.csv) given in row 3 of *mitchell.csv*, was estimated by looking at the respecting dates in the years 2019, 2018, and 2017.  From these three numbers an estimated average was given (no math).  The data utilized for this estimate was obtained via the USGS NWIS [mapper](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/) for the gage number 09506000.  Thank you!
